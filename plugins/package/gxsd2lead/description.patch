-SD2 overdrive pedal simulation
+The SD-2 Lead is modeled after the The BOSS SD-2(*).
+
+The Boss SD-2(*) is a pedal that, just as the DS-1, gained a lot of popularity. From a nice subtle natural overdrive to a more distortion-like sound, the SD-2 hits the spot. With the drive knob turned down, it is even usable as a clean boost. 
+
+Features:
+
+Modeled by the Guitarix team
+
+Based on the BOSS SD-2(*)
