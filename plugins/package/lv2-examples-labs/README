Special NOTE: LV2 bundles should not be stored in this repository!

We make an exception here for eg-sampler in order to help develop development.
The eg-sampler is very useful to quickly change and check implementation of MOD stuff.

We can make use eg-sampler to test:

1. state save/restore support
2. file handling
3. parameter API (through patch messages, as eg-sampler has a gain parameter)
4. modgui with file handling support
5. sending raw message from modgui to plugin (a MIDI note for eg-sampler's case)
